# how to use
- connect to openvpn
- clone the repo
- cd into the directory which you cloned the repo into
- install node modules
```javascript
npm install
```
- run the node.js server with :
```javascript
node src/server.js
```
- run the development server :
```javascript
npm start
```

## status
- this code is potentially not working as i updated the code without being able to test,
since a special vpn connection must be set in order for this to work
